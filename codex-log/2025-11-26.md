# Codex Log — 2025-11-26

## Step 1
- Added admin listings statistics endpoint `POST /admin/properties/stats` with filters (from/to date, states, statuses) returning counts by status and total listings.
- Improved status mapping to include `FOR_SALE_AGAIN` (maps to FOR_SALE) and `COMING_SOON`.
- Import flow now enforces status presence, batches property/listing upserts, uses the `state_outreach` GSI to ingest `outreach = 0`, and marks processed items to `outreach = 1`.
- Added summary (`POST /admin/properties/stats/summary`) and paginated state-level breakdown (`POST /admin/properties/stats/state-breakdown`) endpoints; breakdown returns per-state counts for FOR_SALE/PENDING/COMING_SOON.
- Pagination supported on state breakdown via `limit`/`offset`; requested states are included even when counts are zero.
- Added `PropertyBaseEnrichment` entity/repository, registered with TypeORM, and linked to `Property`.
- Removed `initialScrapeStatus` (legacy) from `Property`; status lives in listings.
